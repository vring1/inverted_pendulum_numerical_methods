# Numerical Methods in Physics

The problem, balancing the inverted pendulum on a moving cart, was solved using python, numerical methods and the equation of motion. The program was developed with reference to course NFYB14002U Numerical Methods in Physics at University of Copenhagen. The code resides in the `group_project` directory.
