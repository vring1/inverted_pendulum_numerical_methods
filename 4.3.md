Solve ∇^2 f(x, y) = 0 with the boundary conditions and 
plot your solution together with the ropes.
You can use ax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z, antialiased=False).

INFORMATION TO SOLVE THE TASK:

For higher-dimensional PDEs we will often encounter the Lapla-
cian: ∇2. It is useful to a have a finite difference scheme handy
specifically for this operator. The standard choice is to use central
finite differences along all dimensions:

With regular grid-spacing the discrete Laplace operator is
defined as 
Eq. (4.27): ∇2 f (x_i, y_j) = (∂_x^2 + ∂_y^2)f(x_i,y_j) = 1/Δx^2[f(x_{i-1},y_j) + f(x_{i+1},y_j) + f(x_i,y_{j-1}) + f(x_i,y_{j+1}) - 4f(x_i,y_j)]
in two dimensions. It generalises straighforwardly to higher dimensions.

For example, ∇2 f (x, y) for our periodic N = 4 system is represented
by the finite difference expression L f , where

L = 
1/Δx^2*
−4 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
1 −4 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0

Again, make sure you understand just one or two rows. That should be enough to understand the idea and enable you to write a program
that generates such a matrix for any N.

Example 1:
Consider 
∇2 f (x, y) = g(x, y).
The finite difference equation is then simply
L f = g, 
which can be solved using any linear solver after applying
boundary conditions.

Example 2:
Eq. (3.22): A Dirichlet boundary condition specifies the value of the
function at the border, e.g.: f (a) = alpha

Consider again
∇2 f (x, y) = g(x, y).
which we will again approximate using Eq. (4.27). For the
Laplacian matrix L the condition to use the Jacobi method
holds with equality: | − 4| ≥ |1| + |1| + |1| + |1|. A Dirichlet
boundary condition [Eq. (3.22)] will make the full condition
to use the Jacobi method true (in fact this method will typi-
cally also converge for periodic systems if the initial guess is
not too terrible).
The method then requires us to iterate

f (x_i, y_j) ← 1/4 (f(x_{i+1},y_j) + f(x_{i-1},y_j) + f(x_i,y_{j+1}) + f(x_i,y_{j-1}) - g(x_i,y_j) Δx^2 )
where the right-hand side is evaluated for all i, j before the
update. The updates at the boundary points depend on the
boundary conditions.
Note that for this method f (x, y) can be stored as a matrix
instead of as a vector, since we do not need to put it in
a shape suitable for library functions. This can simplify
implementation quite a lot.
